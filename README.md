# My Movies

**This repository is a simple project created for my Studi courses during a live session with a professional developer.**

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Bootstrap 5
- PHP 8.1
- MySQL 

## Project presentation 

The subject of this project was to create a film presentation website, such as "Allocin√©".

Goals :
- Learn the basics of HTML, CSS and PHP web languages.
- Use the BootStrap graphics framework and the relational database management system - MySQL

Using the PHP web language and concepts associated with object-oriented programming (OOP), I set up a CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) of the movies.

I also set up a User's CRUD with a registration form. Once registration is complete, the user is logged in and can log out. The login form is not operational.

## Utilisation
The web application is hosted locally.

To use your own local hosting, it's necessary to enter the following data in an .env file:

```.env
- DATABASE_DNS & HOST
- DATABASE_USER
- DATABASE_PASSWORD
```

Use this command to start a local server : 
```
$ symfony serve
```
